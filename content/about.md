title: 'About Me'
---

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dongpo Liu and Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer who specializes in distributed systems and dev tools.

As a software engineer at [PingCAP], my main focus is on enhancing [TiDB], which is an open-source distributed SQL database. I am also a core maintainer of [TiCDC], which is a Change Data Capture (CDC) system for [TiDB].

I am also a big believer in open source. I contribute to the Rust community, where I am working on two projects:

- [cargo] - Cargo downloads your Rust packageâ€™s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages.
- [crates.io] - The Rust package registry.

Programming languages I primarily code in: Rust/Go/TypeScript/JavaScript.

Languages I speak:

- English (Professional working proficiency)
- Chinese (Native proficiency)
