title: 'About Me'
---

My name is Rustin Liu and I’m a passionate software engineer who specializes in distributed systems and dev tools.

As a software engineer at [PingCAP], my main focus is on enhancing [TiDB], which is an open-source distributed SQL database. I am also a core maintainer of [TiCDC], which is a Change Data Capture (CDC) system for [TiDB].

I am also a big believer in open source. I contribute to the Rust community, where I am working on two areas:

- Package management
  - [cargo] - Cargo downloads your Rust package’s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages.
  - [crates.io] - The Rust package registry.
- Async Runtime
  - [tokio] - An asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language.
  - [console] - A debugger for async rust!
  - [tokio-console-web] - A web-based debugger for async rust!

Programming languages I primarily code in:

- Rust
- Go
- TypeScript/JavaScript


Languages I speak:

- English (Professional working proficiency)
- Chinese (Native proficiency)
