[![Resume][resume-badge]][resume] [![GitHub][github-badge]][github] [![Linkedin][linkedin-badge]][linkedin]

My name is Rustin Liu and I'm a passionate developer interested in distributed systems, build systems, and performance.

As a software engineer at [PingCAP], my focus is on enhancing [TiCDC], which serves as the change data capture tool for [TiDB].

Aside from my work, I am an active contributor to [Rust] community. Presently, I am working on two projects - ["Cargo: The Rust package manager"] and ["Rustup: The Rust toolchain installer"].

Additionally, I am also exploring the field of [continuous profiling] and trying to build a tool to help developers profile their applications in production.

Things I code with: Rust, Golang, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.

You can contact me by clicking badges above, or e-mail me directly (address is on the GitHub profile)ðŸ˜€.
