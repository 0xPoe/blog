My name is Rustin Liu and I’m a passionate software engineer who specializes in distributed systems, build systems, and programming tools.

As a software engineer at [PingCAP], my main focus is on enhancing [TiCDC], which serves as the change data capture tool for [TiDB].

I am also a big believer in open source. I contribute to the [Rust] community, where I am working on two projects:

- ["Cargo: The Rust package manager"] - Cargo downloads your Rust package’s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages.

- ["Rustup: The Rust toolchain installer"] - Rustup installs Rust from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated.

Currently learning: I am exploring the field of [continuous profiling] and trying to build a tool to help developers profile their applications in production.

Programming languages I primarily code in:

- Rust
  - [![cargo-commits][cargo-commits]](<https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commits?author=hi-rustin>)
  - [![rustup-commits][rustup-commits]](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [![rust-commits][rust-commits]](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [![tikv-commits][tikv-commits]](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [![built-my-own-x-commits][built-my-own-x-commits]](https://github.com/hi-rustin/build-my-own-x/commits?author=hi-rustin)
    - [Build my own database]
    - [Build my own operating system]
    - [Leetcode solutions in Rust]
- Golang
  - [![tiflow-commits][tiflow-commits]](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [![tichi-commits][tichi-commits]](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/tichi/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [![kubernetes-test-infra-commits][kubernetes-test-infra-commits]](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [![phlare-commits][phlare-commits]](https://github.com/grafana/phlare/commits?author=hi-rustin)
- TypeScript/JavaScript
  - [![ant-design-commits][ant-design-commits]](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [![tispace-commits][tispace-commits]](https://github.com/tispace-dev/tispace/commits?author=hi-rustin)

Languages I speak:

- English (Professional working proficiency)
- Chinese (Native proficiency)
