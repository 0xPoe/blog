[![Resume][resume-badge]][resume] [![GitHub][github-badge]][github] [![Linkedin][linkedin-badge]][linkedin]

My name is Rustin Liu and Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer who specializes in distributed systems, build systems, and programming tools.

As a software engineer at [PingCAP], my main focus is on enhancing [TiCDC], which serves as the change data capture tool for [TiDB].

Iâ€™m also a big believer in open source.

I am an active contributor to [Rust] community, where Iâ€™m working on two projects:

["Cargo: The Rust package manager"] - Cargo downloads your Rust packageâ€™s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages.

["Rustup: The Rust toolchain installer"] - Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the oï¬€icial release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated.

Currently learning:  I am exploring the field of [continuous profiling] and trying to build a tool to help developers profile their applications in production.

Languages I primarily code in:

- Rust
  - [Cargo: 156+ commits](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [Rustup: 110+ commits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [Rust: 64+ commits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=hi-rustin)

- Golang
  - [TiFlow: 299+ commits](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [TiChi: 365+ commits](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/tichi/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [Kubernetes Test Infra: 39+ commits](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/commits?author=hi-rustin)
  - [Phlare: 31+ commits](https://github.com/grafana/phlare/commits?author=hi-rustin)
- TypeScript/JavaScript
  - [Ant Design: 19+ commits](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/commits?author=hi-rustin)
